# Chrome Extensions
This repository contains the source code for chrome browser extensions and their releases.

### 1. Bookmark Crawler
This extension lets you search for things in your old bookmarks and if it doesn't find the content, it will query google and open up the search results page in a new window/tab(as per your settings).

#### Usage:
To install `Bookmark Crawler` follow steps below:

* Download the `bookmarkcrawler.crx` file.
* Drag and drop it into chrome and follow the onscreen instructions.

#### Issues v0.1.0:
* HTML content in the bookmark title was not encoded hence leading to odd behavior. This has been fixed in `v0.2.0`

If any issues are found in v0.2.0 please email them to [`sidharth.mishra@sjsu.edu`](mailto:sidharth.mishra@sjsu.edu)
